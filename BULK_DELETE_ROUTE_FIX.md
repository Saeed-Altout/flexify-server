# ðŸ”§ Bulk Delete Route Fix

## Problem

The bulk delete endpoint was failing with this error:

```json
{
  "message": "Failed to fetch image: invalid input syntax for type uuid: \"bulk\"",
  "error": "Bad Request",
  "statusCode": 400
}
```

## âœ… Root Cause

The issue was with **route order** in the controller. The `@Delete(':id')` route was catching the `bulk` path before it could reach the `@Delete('bulk')` route.

In NestJS/Express, routes are matched in the order they're defined, and `:id` is a wildcard that matches any string, including "bulk".

## ðŸš€ Solution Applied

**Before (Problematic Order):**

```typescript
@Get(':id')           // This catches /images/bulk
@Delete(':id')        // This catches DELETE /images/bulk
@Delete('bulk')       // This never gets reached!
```

**After (Fixed Order):**

```typescript
@Delete('bulk')       // Specific route first
@Get(':id')           // Wildcard routes after
@Delete(':id')        // Wildcard routes after
```

## ðŸŽ¯ Key Rule

**Always put specific routes BEFORE wildcard routes** to ensure proper matching.

## ðŸ§ª Now Working

### âœ… Bulk Delete Request

```bash
DELETE /api/v1/images/bulk
Content-Type: application/json

{
    "image_ids": [
        "7634655e-44f5-4dca-8ece-776d46851070",
        "e360cc84-8fac-4931-97ae-8f9612568284",
        "fef8b6d4-e953-4c99-9814-77d1f2eb1395"
    ]
}

# Response (200 OK):
{
    "data": {
        "deleted_count": 3,
        "deleted_ids": [
            "7634655e-44f5-4dca-8ece-776d46851070",
            "e360cc84-8fac-4931-97ae-8f9612568284",
            "fef8b6d4-e953-4c99-9814-77d1f2eb1395"
        ]
    },
    "message": "Images deleted successfully",
    "status": "success"
}
```

### âœ… Individual Delete Still Works

```bash
DELETE /api/v1/images/7634655e-44f5-4dca-8ece-776d46851070

# Response (200 OK):
{
    "data": {
        "deleted_id": "7634655e-44f5-4dca-8ece-776d46851070",
        "deleted_url": "https://storage.example.com/path/to/image.jpg"
    },
    "message": "Image deleted successfully",
    "status": "success"
}
```

### âœ… Get Image Still Works

```bash
GET /api/v1/images/7634655e-44f5-4dca-8ece-776d46851070
```

## ðŸŽ‰ Result

The bulk delete endpoint now works correctly and returns proper success responses with data! All other endpoints continue to function as expected.
